# ComiCord

Your favourite Comic Sans Vencord theme.

Sadly, I couldn't find all the text elements. Most text is in comic sans though. I'll update the theme if I find more.

## Install

### vencord / betterdiscord / etc

1. Use the Online Link version, by going to themes > online themes and pasting in the following: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squairdev/ComiCord/main/ComiCord.css`

2. Add the [ComicCord.css](https://github.com/squairdev/ComiCord/raw/main/ComiCord.css) file to your themes folder.

As you can see, most of the content is in Comic Sans. (Not all... yet.)
